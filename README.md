# FLOOD LEVEL ESTIMATION USING MOBILE PHONE GENERATED IMAGES



Flood is one of the most distructive disasters in the world. More than half of the flood disaster occur is developing parts of the world, thus exposing the most vulterable people on planet to its unfortunate effects.
Major causes of flood events include heavy rainfall, high tides and human factors such as deforestation, poor waste management, irregular urbanization etc. With the aggravating effects of climate change set to rise in the coming years, 
flooding risks might also become significant in developed countries.

Since the risks are majorly concentrated in low-resource countries, solutions and ways of managing this problem must also be of very low cost. One very important solution point is the use of available data sources to track human falalities and direct intervention and rescue operations.
In the past, remotely sensed data from satellites have been used to retrieve  flood-water level from the disaster areas. This technique, though inexpensive, doesn't provide near real-time monitoring capabilities. This is because freely available remotely sensed data usable for this purpose are available at relatively low temporal resolution. 

Other techniques that have been used also include stream guage and field data collection. These techniques are both expensive and thus cannot scale well.

A viable alternative is the use of real-time mobile phone camera images or images from social media platforms readily annotated with user-shared texts.
These data can be available for free and in real-time, however they require heavy cleaning, annotation and pre-processing in other to make them meaningful.
Other researchers already addressed this problem. We intend to extend the work they did fitting a similar model and deploying it on the edge using Intel OpenVINO deployment toolkit.
